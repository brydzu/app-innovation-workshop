# Project Spec

## Customer Overview
Contoso Maintenance is an Airline maintenance business, specializing in servicing aircraft in Northern Europe. 

It currently employes >250 engineers who are responsible for ensuring the air-worthiness of the aircraft they're repairing. 

The business has been slow to adopt to changes in their processes and have seen customers sign maintenance contracts with their main competitor who has completed a digital transformation process. 

The business is looking to level the playing field through the building and deploying mobile apps that utilise artificial intelligence to increase engineer productivity.  

## Current Process
The engineers currently receive a number of faxes every morning which contains information on the maintenance tasks required to be completed that day. 

The engineer will log any notes and report back at the end of the working day (through Fax)

Spare parts are ordered on a dedicated phone line, which often has long wait times and requires a fulltime employee to be on hand to answer the call.

## Proposed Solution

* It should be possible to retrieve a list of jobs. 


### Supported Platforms
* The app should run on iOS 7 and above
* The app should run on Android v4.4 and above
