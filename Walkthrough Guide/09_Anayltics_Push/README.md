# App Center 
App Center offers a rich suit of services aimed at mobile devlopers. We're going to use it today to add crash reporting, anayltics and push notifications. We also have a CI/CD workshop that'll be running which covers the build and testing elements of mobile development. 

## Crash Reporting
App Center Crash Reporting lets us know when our app crashes on any device.

Crashes are grouped together by similarities like the reason for the crash and where the occur in the app. It is possible to inspect each individual crash report for the last 3 months, after that a stub of 25 crashes will be kept.
