# Authentication 
Adding Authentication to our app and backend is a little outside of the scope of todays workshop due to time constraints. We believe Authentication is an important enough topic that we've opted to include a guide for you to get an understanding of the key concepts required to implement any Indentity Provider in to your projects (Obviusly we'd love it if you looked at Active Directory). 

You can find a full tutorial on how to implement Active Directory with ASP.NET on the [AD Documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/windowsauth?tabs=aspnetcore2x)
